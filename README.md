# Background

Women with active ovarian cancer have chemotherapy appointments every two to three weeks. Physicians are concerned about patients visiting the emergency department (ED) between their chemo appointments and want to be able to predict at the end of the chemo appointment if the patient likely visit the ED or to be hospitalized (also called “Unanticipated hospital admission” or UHA) before the next appointment. The clinical team enlists the help of a biostatistician to create a predictive model.
